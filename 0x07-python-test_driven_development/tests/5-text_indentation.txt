==================================
    How text_indentation works
==================================

The module must be imported as follows:

    >>> text_indentation = __import__("5-text_indentation").text_indentation

The function takes in a string, and at each '.', '?' or ':' it adds two
newlines:

    >>> text_indentation("lorem something in latin. It goes on ?")
    lorem something in latin.
    <BLANKLINE>
    It goes on?
    <BLANKLINE>

Any spaces found at the beginning or end of the line (delimited by previous
characters) are sliced off:

    >>> text_indentation(" spaces at beginning : spaces at end of line . Check ?")
    spaces at beginning:
    <BLANKLINE>
    spaces at end of line.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Check?
    <BLANKLINE>

The function only takes strings as arguments:

    >>> text_indentation(1234) #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: text must be a string
